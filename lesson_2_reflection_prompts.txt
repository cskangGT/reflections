What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

First of all, we can create the repository in a directory that already contatins files or empty file.( Guess: repository means that we are makeing the directory that we can do version controls --> what it means that we make a directory the git repository )
    If you initialize a repository, then we create a new git repository, then we will be able to see .git in the directory.
        Also, for the git status, you will see that both files are listed as untracked files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory has all the files that's in directory.
and staging area is the stage that you put files to be commited on, lastly repository is the place where you saved all the commits.
    It's possible to make user to choose what a bundles of commits the user want to save for the changes. And Repository will be able to show the history of commits more logically and specifically.
